## ❓ What is this?

A testing assingment from [OAK'S LAB](https://www.oakslab.com/). Here's the brief:

<img src="https://oaks.cibulka.codes/brief.png" />

I've finished the task in approx 2 hours (check my commit history to see in detail), however I took some extra time to write a solid documentation (as everyone should 😊).

## 🤔  Proposed solutions

<details>
  <summary><strong>Unlimited tasks (and unlimited groups)</strong></summary>
  <br />

This FE solution assumes that:

- all the tasks are coming from some endpoint
- each entity (Task and Group) has unique numeric ID, generated by back-end
- each Task is assigned to a single specific group

The UI is ready for unlimited number of both tasks and group.

I've saved the dummy data to [/constants/task.ts](https://github.com/cibulka/oaks-lab-todo/blob/main/src/constants/task.ts). In reality they would most probably be fetched either on server (with the help of Next.js server components) or client (through `useEffect`). While they are fetched, the spinner would be present in the UI (to improve [perceieved performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceived_performance) and to prevent [cumulative layout shift](https://www.google.com/search?q=cumulative+layout+shift)).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Reopen tasks (undo)</strong></summary>
  <br />

Any task can be undone. There are two scenarios:

- **Task is not a blocker** => it is undone without any confirmation
- **Task is a blocker** => modal appears, prompting user to confirm with reopening the task. If they proceed with undoing the task, UI shows all the tasks further in the queue as "invalid". This situation should be also handled further on BE - for instance by adding the flag `isBlocked: boolean` to the "invalid tasks".

Each group is also marked by its completion:

- 🎉 means "completed"
- ⚠️ means "completed", but with an undone task in the sequence

</details>

## 🚀  Tech stack

<details>
  <summary>▲ <strong>Next.js</strong></summary>
  <br />
  
  Not strictly needed for this project - it even adds a small hiccup with **server side rendering**: as `localStorage` is a browser feature, it is not available on server, so one needs to "suspend" the UI before it is hydrated.

Why have I used it then?

- It is a tool that I'm very comfortable working
- The setup through `create-next-app` is ridiculously fast (including TypeScript and Tailwind)
- The preview of the project is easy to setup on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

I am also using the [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) (with server components and so-called "app folder"), but for this project it is not very relevant.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>📊 <strong>React context (and `useReducer` pattern)</strong></summary>
  <br />
  
I like `useReducer` pattern a lot, as it puts all side effects to one place (including the usage of `localStorage`).

I also believe that (in combination with React Context) it is so powerful, that in most cases an extra solution for state management (such as `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, etc.) is not really needed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>💨 <strong>Tailwind</strong></summary>
  <br />
  
  I like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) very much. ❤️ Those are the benefits I see:
  - Readability of the code
  - Fully static, so no surprises on production
  - Very fast development speed
  - Very good defaults (typography scale, color palette), that still "do not look like Tailwind" (as oposed to MUI or Boostrap)

It is even intergrated with `next-create-app`, so one does not need to waste time on extra setup.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>😶 <strong>Headless UI</strong></summary>
  <br />
  
  [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) provides a "Completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS".

I've used it for the Modal component, to improve its accesibility and UX (why still having full control over its style).

</details>

## ➕  Room for improvements

I believe I fulfilled all the requirements of the assingment in the time limit of 2 hours (check my commit history). There is however always room for improvement. :) This what I would do next:

1. **Adding / editing new tasks** - I would use Next.js endpoints and save the tasks into simple JSON files (which I would later access through filesystem).
2. **Tooltips** - Add tooltips to icons and emojis in the UI with further explanation.
3. **i18n** - Implement localization of UI to multiple languages with [`i18nnext` library](https://www.i18next.com/).
4. **Transitions / animations** - To make changes in the UI less sudden.

## 🔧  Install & Use

You can visit the demo of the project on https://oaks.cibulka.codes or run it locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev # For development
npm run build && npm start # For production preview
```
